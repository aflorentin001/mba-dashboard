## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aflorentin001/mba-dashboard.git
   cd mba-dashboard
   ```

2. **Open the dashboard**

## ‚å®Ô∏è Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `R` | Reset all filters |
| `E` | Export filtered rules to CSV |
| `Esc` | Close detail panel |
| `?` | Show keyboard shortcuts help |

## üìä Data Structure

The dashboard expects association rules in the following format:

```javascript
{
  id: 1,
  antecedents: ["item1", "item2"],
  consequents: ["item3"],
  support: 0.0104,
  confidence: 0.3592,
  lift: 3.2950
}
```

## üé® Customization

### Adding Your Own Data

Replace the `rulesData` array in `index.html` (around line 600) with your own association rules:

```javascript
const rulesData = [
  {
    id: 1,
    antecedents: ["your", "items"],
    consequents: ["target", "items"],
    support: 0.01,
    confidence: 0.5,
    lift: 2.5
  },
  // ... more rules
];
```

### Color Scheme

The dashboard uses a professional color palette:
- **High lift (‚â•3.0)**: Green (#10b981) - Exceptional association
- **Medium lift (2.7-3.0)**: Blue (#3b82f6) - Strong association
- **Low lift (<2.7)**: Gray (#6b7280) - Moderate association

## üìà Metrics Interpretation

### Support
- **>0.015**: High impact (affects many customers)
- **0.01-0.015**: Moderate frequency
- **<0.01**: Niche opportunity

### Confidence
- **>0.4**: High reliability
- **0.25-0.4**: Moderate reliability
- **<0.25**: Lower reliability

### Lift
- **>3.0**: Exceptionally strong association
- **2.7-3.0**: Strong association
- **<2.7**: Moderate association
